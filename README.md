Starting Date: 2019/11/06

Before the starting date I have read the master thesis "Memory efficient algorithms and implementations for solving small-board-sized Go". The program of this thesis works correctly but rather inefficient and have space for improvement.

I will implement a efficient and succint program on calculating small boards of Go for further usage of Monte-Carlo or Neural Network.
